      We took a deep dive into traditional carbonara, tracing it back to its
      roots as a peasant dish made with pantry ingredients, and re-considered
      every factor. The result? Less pasta, more crispy-chewy strips of
      guanciale, and more silky creamy egg to hold it all together. When you buy
      the guanciale, make sure to ask for it in one piece so that you can cut it
      into chunky strips that will turn chewy-crispy and find their way into the
      pasta tubes as you toss together the sauce.
